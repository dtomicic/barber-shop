## Project task
Project task was to build a website for the barber shop from the ground up (design and everything).

## Project overview
Didn't have any bigger problems throughout the project, everything went smoothly. Only things left to do is make the form functional (I didn't do it as this website was just for practice not for use), but that's a half an hour job and that would be about it everything else is in place and functional.
